  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM configuration updates invoked from the Kali Linux machine. IAM Configuration changes such as creating, deleting users/groups, or modifying policies are triggered from Kali Linux by IAM API calls using credentials that belong to your AWS account.

Attackers might use this tool to find configuration weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to your AWS environment.",
