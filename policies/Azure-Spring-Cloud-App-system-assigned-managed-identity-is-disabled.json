  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Spring Cloud apps in which system-assigned managed identity is disabled. System-assigned managed identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in a code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. So as a security best practice, it is recommended to have the system-assigned managed identity to your Spring Cloud apps.",
