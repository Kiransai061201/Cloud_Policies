  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets that are not associated with a Network Security Group (NSG). While binding an NSG to a network interface of a Virtual Machine (VM) enables fine-grained control to the VM, associating a NSG to a subnet enables better control over network traffic to all resources within a subnet. As a best practice, associate an NSG with a subnet so that you can protect your VMs on a subnet-level.\n\nFor more information,\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/igorpag/2016/05/14/azure-network-security-groups-nsg-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#limitations\n\nNote: This policy will not report for subnets used by Azure Firewall, Gateway, NetApp File Share, Private endpoints and Private links as Azure recommends not to configure Network Security Group (NSG) for these services.",
