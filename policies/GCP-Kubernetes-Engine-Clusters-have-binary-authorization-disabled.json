  "description": "This policy identifies Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters that have disabled binary authorization. Binary authorization is a security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on GKE clusters. As a best practice, verify images prior to deployment to reduce the risk of running unintended or malicious code in your environment.",
